			<h3>Who is West Bay Clinical Research?</h3>
			<br>
			<p>
				West Bay Clinical Research was founded in 2003 as a multi-service and multi-specialty clinical research center. We have participated in over thirty pharmaceutical and biotechnology research trials in the last decade. We have strong relationships with many physicians throughout Rhode Island. These relationships allow us the ability to obtain patients that would benefit from our trials and offer expert investigators to our sponsors.
