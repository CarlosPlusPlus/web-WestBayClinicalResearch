        <p>
          West Bay Clinical Research was founded in 2003 as a multi-service and multi-specialty clinical research center. We have participated in over thirty pharmaceutical and biotechnology research trials in the last decade. We have strong relationships with many physicians throughout Rhode Island. These relationships allow us the ability to obtain patients that would benefit from our trials and offer expert investigators to our sponsors.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our center has also provided Medical Monitoring services to Pharmaceutical and Contract Research Organizations (CRO) for studies with sites in the United States, Canada, and Europe.  We have also provided MeDRA database coding services for CRO’s and Sponsors.
